Oh, Father tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Whoa, we get what we deserve

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say way down we go
Way down we go

You let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all, oh, go down
Yeah but for the fall, ooh, my
Do you dare to look him right in the eyes? Yeah

Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down 'til the dark
Yes and they will run you down, down 'til you fall
And they will run you down, down 'til you go
Yeah, so you can't crawl no more

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say way down we go
Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down 'til you fall
Way down we go

Oh baby, yeah
Oh, baby
Baby
Way down we go
Yeah

And way down we go
Way down we go
Say way down we go, ooh
Way down we go
